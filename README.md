# Simple Math Cheat Sheets

I have learned math multiple times and on different levels during my life.
I am far from the best mathematician in the world. I even can't pretend that
I know (and use) all the stuff I ever learned.

Yet, I am learning a new math stuff here and there and developed a
habit to write basics down just for better memorizing.

Here comes my attempt to "digitize" my write-downs in form of pure TeX sheets.
I am not sure it will ever be complete, but I hope it will be useful for others.

This work is heavily inspired by Steve Seiden's [Theoretical Computer Science
Cheat Sheet](https://www.tug.org/texshowcase). I have took many formulas and
ideas from there, but I use a little bit different layout.
Note that I am not an expert TeX user, any comments for improvement are welcome.
